			<h2 class="name">Ebuy Lanka International</h2>
			<p class="time">Early 2019 - Mid 2019</p>
			<p class="description">Ebuy Lanka International marked Dhananjaya's first venture into the world of business. Launched in February 2019 as an e-commerce platform, the project unfortunately faced challenges and had to be closed down by mid-2019. Despite initial aspirations, Ebuy Lanka International struggled to generate sales and failed to gain traction in the competitive online marketplace. This early experience taught valuable lessons about the importance of market research, marketing strategies, and building a strong customer base for sustainable success in the e-commerce industry.</p>
